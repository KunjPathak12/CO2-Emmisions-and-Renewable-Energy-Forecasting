Predicting CO2 Emissions and Renewable Energy for Sustainable Development

Processed a large dataset, addressing missing data, outliers, and performing feature selection using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to refine the total features down to 10.
Leveraged Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly for sophisticated data visualizations, revealing key trends and correlations to support decision-making.
Developed time series forecasting models using Prophet and ARIMA, combining their results with regression models to enhance prediction accuracy through a Random Forest Regressor.
